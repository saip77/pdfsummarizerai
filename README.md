# pdfsummarizerai
This project is a **PDF Summarizer Web App** built with **Streamlit**. It allows users to upload a PDF file, extract its content, and summarize it using Google's **Gemini API** (a Generative AI model). Key features include:

- PDF Upload: Users can upload a PDF file using a file uploader.
- PDF Text Extraction: Extracts the text from the uploaded PDF.
- Text Summarization: The extracted text is summarized in 60 words using the Gemini API.
- Output Display: Summarized content is displayed in the web app.

It also uses environment variables for API key configuration and integrates **YouTubeTranscriptApi** (though not utilized in the current code).
